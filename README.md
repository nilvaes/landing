Hey!!

I was really excited to code a website from zero to this.
But as i found out, it wasn't easy to code just with looking a picture.
But as a beginner i feel great after completing it and i hope my logic in CSS makes sense.

I want to thank again to TOR Community and the ones who created this opportunity and letting people learn for free.

Wish you a great day!
Thanks for reading ~
